# rust_from_overloading

Source for an article I wrote exploring one way to overload struct methods in Rust. The article, so long as it will continue to be hosted, [can be read here](https://macsimum.life/?p=152).

Rust can be installed or tried out in an online compiler at [Rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

To compile on a local machine, navigate to the rust_from_overloading directory, compile with **cargo build** or **cargo build --release**, and run the executable it produces in a console.
